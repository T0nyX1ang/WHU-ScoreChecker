## Usage

### Captcha model download

* Please download the captcha model [here](https://github.com/T0nyX1ang/WHU-ScoreChecker/releases/tag/model-v1).
* The model is in `HDF5` format, which is a training result with over 2400000 entries and over 95% accuracy.
* You'd better put the downloaded model in the `./static` directory of this repository.

### Query model

* Some query models is included this project on Github. They are inside the `./static` directory.
* If you just want to check all of your scores, load the `./static/default.json` model.
* If you want to do different jobs, take a look at the `./static/example.json` model, it includes all you need.
* The query model parser is under construction and can't deal with very difficult jobs at this time.

```bash
	# Note that query model examples are not included when using pip
